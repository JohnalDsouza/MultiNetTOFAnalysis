## Understanding the dataset
The dataset comprises measurements from a Time-of-Flight (TOF) camera, utilized for estimating material thickness. Each row in the dataset represents a pixel value corresponding to a specific point on the material thickness being analyzed. The dataset features real and imaginary parts of signals received at eight different frequencies, labeled as realPart_1 to realPart_8 and imaginaryPart_1 to imaginaryPart_8, respectively. These components capture the phase shift of the light as it bounces back from the material, providing essential information about the material's surface and its thickness. Additionally, the dataset includes a ninth real part, realPart_9, which denotes the angle between the TOF camera and the material's surface. The combination of real, imaginary parts, and the angle information provides a comprehensive set of features for analyzing material properties using advanced machine learning techniques, particularly focusing on neural network models designed for 1D data analysis.
