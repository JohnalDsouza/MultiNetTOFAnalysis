# TOFMultiscopeNetAnalysis: A Comprehensive Analysis Framework for Material Thickness Estimation Using TOF Data

## Overview
TOFMultiscopeNetAnalysis is an innovative research framework dedicated to advancing the field of material science and non-invasive measurement techniques through the application of cutting-edge neural network architectures. This project leverages Time-of-Flight (TOF) imaging data to estimate material thickness with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. By systematically comparing the performance of various neural network models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), InceptionNet, and DenseNet, TOFMultiscopeNetAnalysis aims to identify the most effective strategies for TOF data analysis in real-world applications.

The project focuses on the utilization of multiple neural network architectures to understand their efficacy in analyzing TOF data for the purpose of material thickness estimation. Through rigorous experimentation and comparative analysis, TOFMultiscopeNetAnalysis seeks to provide insights and guidelines that can be applied across various domains requiring precise material analysis.
